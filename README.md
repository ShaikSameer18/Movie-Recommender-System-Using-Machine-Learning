Movie Recommender System Using Machine Learning!
Workflow:
Recommendation systems are essential tools in todayâ€™s busy world. They help users make efficient choices by providing personalized recommendations based on their profiles, browsing history, and preferences.

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based movie recommendation system, allowing users to discover movies similar to their interests. It leverages Streamlit for the interface and combines advanced techniques for recommendation generation.

Types of Recommendation Systems:
1. Content-Based:
Utilizes item attributes to form recommendations based on what the user has interacted with.
Example: Recommendations based on genres, actors, or directors of movies previously watched.
Challenges: Over-specialization can lead to obvious or overly narrow recommendations.
2. Collaborative Filtering:
Builds clusters of users with similar interests or ratings to generate recommendations.
Example: "Users who liked this movie also liked..."
Challenges: Computationally expensive and biased toward popular items, leaving new or niche items unconsidered.
3. Hybrid Systems:
Combines content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to overcome their limitations.
Widely used due to its balance and effectiveness.
Dataset Used:
TMDB Movie Dataset: Includes metadata for movies such as genres, keywords, and popularity scores.
Algorithm Used: Cosine Similarity
Measures similarity between two vectors (e.g., movie feature vectors).
Generates a score between [0, 1], where:
1 indicates complete similarity.
0 indicates complete dissimilarity.
